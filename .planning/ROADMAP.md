### 📋 v1.2 (Planned)

Next milestone TBD — kick off with `/gsd-new-milestone`. Forward-looking SEEDs (dormant) that may inform v1.2 scope:

- SEED-001: Replace rubric-style judge with full agent tool-use loop
- SEED-002: Tool-level parallelism via pytest-xdist with read/write resource markers
- SEED-003: Dynamic judging protocol — rubrics as data, not code
- SEED-004: Stateful tool testing with resource setup/teardown
- SEED-005: OpenAI-compatible judge backend as the unifier (local-first / hosted-opt-in)
